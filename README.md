# Connect - INFO 200
Repo for Info 200AB Group 6's website, Connect. Written by Dakota Miller, concept, design, and content by David Yuan, Julia Ragsdale, Karl Parry, and Dakota Miller.

## About the demo site
This website is not fully functioning, nor was it intended to be. The goal was to show off our concept and design, and give the impression of back-end functionality. The code is not as great as it could be, but as this is not a programming class I focused more on the UI than on a well built backend. There have been two sample user accounts and four sample jobs created to show off the site. Logging in or signing up with the 
```

```
 email account (password doesn't matter) will allow you to view a posted job on the MyJobs page that has users interested in it. Also, you'll be able to view your completed profile. Logging in or signing up with any random valid email address will prompt you to create a profile, and allow you to save jobs, view the create a listing form, and view your saved jobs.  

## Important Features Not Yet Functional
The two main forms on the site, for posting a listing and saving a profile, are not connected to the backend. The data entered is saved nowhere on submit, it is merely intended as a design demo. Additionally, some filters and sorts like zip code, date, and payrate are not functional. Finally, the authentication system is merely a design demo and email checker, password does nothing and new users are not saved.
